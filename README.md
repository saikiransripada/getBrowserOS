getBrowserOS
============

getBrowserOS is 2 very simple PHP functions to fetch the Browser and Operating System from user agent data. It's made for simple, non-important situations and is offered as a light alternative to using PHP's built in function `get_browser()` which requires the `browscap.ini` file to be up to date.

It has been split into 2 seperate functions to give the option of which information you require depending on your situation.


Reliability
===========

As user agent data is not 100% realiable, this function shouldn't be used as accurate data or for anything of major importance.
